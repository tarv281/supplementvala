- _When was last time you clicked on a Promotional Email? People ignore such Emails and may even report it spam. Push Notifications which are sent from Mobile app have shown 10 times more open rate than Email Marketing Campaigns. And this can only be achieved with Mobile app notification._
- _Gaining Loyal customers is crucial for the success of your E-Commerce business. Only a mobile app can help you build a direct channel between you and your customers._
- _Cart abandonment is a nightmare for E-Commerce store owners. By monitoring the user activities within the app and using In-app notifications, push notification to notify the customer about the Flash discount makes the user do an immediate purchase instead of abandoning the cart. There is an 80% lesser cart abandonment on mobile app when compared to a website._
- _With the mobile app, you can reduce checkout by auto-fill forms and saved payment methods. This reduces the fiction of your users. Mobile app checkout happens in 26 seconds or less. This helps tremendously to increase sales and E-Commerce growth._
